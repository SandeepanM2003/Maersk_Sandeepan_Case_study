Vessel Class: Represents a vessel arriving at the terminal, berthing, and unloading containers.

arrive: Handles the arrival and berthing of the vessel.
unload: Manages the unloading process using a quay crane and trucks.
Terminal Class: Represents the container terminal with berths, quay cranes, and trucks.

Vessel Generator: Continuously generates vessels arriving at the terminal based on an exponential distribution.

Simulation Setup: Creates the SimPy environment and terminal, starts the vessel generator, and runs the simulation for a specified time.

This code follows best practices such as modular design, use of classes to encapsulate behavior, and clear logging for simulation events. Adjust SIMULATION_TIME as needed to run the simulation for different durations.
